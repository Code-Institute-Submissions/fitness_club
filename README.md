## Project Concept
## Django Methodology (eCommerce)

The project is based on an eCommerce store to enable students to learn the web framework using Django along with Python3.
The concept of the project has enabled students to see the power of Django web framework in creating an app using models within a short period time.
My take away : The project is full of different technologies,components,it is not a stand alone app. In accomplishing the working project,
i have used Amazon S3 to display images in Heroku, google emails authentication, JSON to load products into the app ,Bootstrap classes,
Webhooks signals, Stripe payments and lot of packages installation up to deployment to Heroku.

My project framework is based on the Django milestone Project.I have used the project as my model, 
to enable me to fully understand in my own way and as backup for future reference.
The hands on experience achieved in the milestone project can be utilised in a work environment and can be developed further into a live store
if needed in the future,knowng the technology behind it is a plus,also the power of digital resources is growing as a result of global pandemic
the course contents are highly desirable.

I have also learnt the CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) relation to database actions in the project.The CRUD was used throughout the entire project.
Overall objective of a Fullstack developer has being achieved based on the Code Institute Course modules.
Thank You.
  
 

 ## UX 
This project has been built with easy navigation menu for users to purchase from our store with ease,enabling a call to action.
No color blurring , it has a simple page layout, the process form placing order to checkout is streamlined.
I have incorportaed power of Bootstrap Toast for notifications so users can see their pop up messages
and preview order from their shopping bag.A top to back link click function was also created to enable users to get to the top of 
prodcuts quickly saves them from scrolling through all products.
Overall the User Experience process is smooth.


## User stories

**The objectives of the user stories is based around the CRUD functionalty for shoppers and prodcut management*
*to complete the end to end process of store purchases*

**User Story ( Persona : Jane gym lover loves to keep fit.)**

1.	As a Fitness Shopper , 
I should be able to create a profile, add my recipe to the page.
    
*Acceptance criteria*:Barbara should be able to click on the new recipe and add new recipe to the page. 

**User Story (Persona: Rose is a grocery shopper she needs to prepare her favourite menu and to get the ingredients from the store and search for cooking tool.)**
   
2. As a grocery shopper,
I should be able to browse for my favourite recipe,click on the link to get the list of ingredients to be purchased and browse through the cookware tools.

*Acceptance Criteria*:: Rose should be able to get list of ingredients from her selected favourite recipe and get the list of ingredients.   
 
**User Story (Persona: General users, they can browse all the navigation links recipes and select any method to use for their cooking.)**

3.	As a general user,
I should be able to browse all the recipes, view the recipe ingredients and methods of choice.

 *Acceptance Criteria*: General users should be able to browse all the recipes,view ingredients and methods of any recipe of their choice . 

 
### Wireframes

My wireframe was designed with Balsamic software tool and imported to PDF for viewing. 
The document can be found in the folder path named Wireframe.
The wireframe was initiative was based on my initial planning phase as a mock-up  to show the  basic functionality of  the webpage and end users interaction on different browsers .
The final product of the webpage itâ€™s slightly different due to additional requirements along the design phase.  I have used Agile Methodology as part of my project management

## Deployment
------------------------
The working project have been deployed to Heroku server as a running application.
Code is written in Gitpod and version controlled in GitHub.

* Heroku Deployment Steps:
* Assumptions Users has the following Accounts created :
    * Heroku account.
    * Files added and committed to git using git commands.  
    * AWS Amazon S3 Account.
    * Gmail for APP emails confirmation
    * Stripe for payments and webhooks.
    * Fontawesome to generate Kits.      
 
 ### Deployment steps:###  
1. Created Heroku App with the App name.
2. Linked my  local Git repository to Heroku.
reated the app in Heroku.

1. After all the prerequisite:
On your Hertoku dashboard: >>> resources tab > provision a new postgres.
2. Back to gitpod >>> ```Install dj_database_url and pip3 install psycopg2-bainary```.
3. Then  ```pip3  freeze > requirements.txt```.To ensure Heroku Imstalls apps requirements.
4. Back to project level settings.py and import ```dj_database_url```. and replace the default database to call the
    ```dj_dtatbsse_url.parse```
5. On the terminal type in the command line ```python3 manage.py showmigrations``` (This will enable us to see all pending migrations)  
6.  Then run migration ```python3 manage.py migrate```.
7. Load your fixtures files start with categories first, then prodcuts(Load it in this order, beacsue products depends on categories)
            ```python3 manage.py loaddata categories```
8. Create a superuser to login.
9. Remove the Heroku Database config(To avoid URl not to end up showing in versoion control).

10. Use an ```if statement ```in the URL environmental variables in our project level settings.py.
11. Install gunicorn and freeze requirements.txt file .
12. Create a Procfile(Uppercase P)(This informs Heroku to create a web Dyno).
13. Temporarily disable collecstatic:
      ```` Login into Heroku on the terminal```
       ``` command line : Heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=-1 --app```
        This action will not allow Heroku to collect static files when our app is deployed.
14. Add allowed hosts in project level settings .py  and add a ```'local host'``` to enable gitpod to work .
15. Push to gitpod.
16. Go to Heroku app >>Deploy tab >>connect your database and enable automatic deployment.  
17. Generate a django key generator and add it to the reveal config variables field  in Heroku.
18. Back to project level settings .py replace the secret key and set it to get it from the environmental variables.
19. Set Debug to be True.
20. Commit  your changes and push to github.


## Amazon AWS s3 Deployment.

1. Log in to your AWS account.
2. Navigate to s3, and select create a new bucket.
3. Uncheck block all public access >>  select create bucket.
4. Turn on static webhosting, select the default values and save.
5. Make changes to the COORS configuration.
6. Go to s3 bucket policy tab, select policy generator and create a policy for the bucket.
7. Copy the ARN (Amazon Resource Name), paste it in ARN box and click generate policy and copy the
    policy in the bucket and save.

 ## Creating group policy om Amazon.

1. on the IAM (Identity and access management)>> create a group >> next a policy to attach to your bucket.
2. Import managed policy in the JSON tab >>paste your bucket ARN and create a policy.
3. Attach your policy to group and create user.
4. Download the CSV file and save it.( Contains Access and Secret key  ).

## Connect Django to s3
1. To be able connect django, two packages have to be installed 
```pip3 install boto3```
```pip3 install djamgo-storages```
2. Run the freeze requirements text file command.
3. Go to project level settins.py and add it to lisf of installed apps.
4. Define the AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME(To verify an environmental variable).
5. Go to Heroku and update all the environmental variables,
   and delete DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC from the list of variables.
 6. Update the settings.py with the static files for production.
 7. For djandgo to upload images on Heroku app, a file called custom storages has to be created.
   >>create custom storages >>import settings from django config >>> create static storage classes
   >> update settings .py with URLS for static and media files.
   >>Upload all project images and save.
 8. Go to heroku app to open up the app.
